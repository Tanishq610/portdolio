                One of the biggest advantages of Python is that it is easy to read because it is a high-level programming language — it reads quite like English. Even novices will find that code starts to make sense to them quite quickly and they can understand it the basics, even if they don’t know everything. This is useful both when you’re starting out writing your own code and when you’re looking at code written by other programmers.
                This readability is also helped by the fact that Python requires proper indentation as part of the syntax — if you don’t use indentation correctly, your program won’t work. This makes Python code better to look at, but critics find the large amount of whitespace wasteful, as you can’t see as much code on your screen at once.
                Overall, Python is much easier to learn than most programming languages and makes a great first programming language.

                    JavaScript in combination with HTML5 is evolving at a fast pace. This is a combination of me learning something new every day and other JS developers making genuinely new and awesome stuff.  Things that we never would have imagined being doable in the browser before suddenly are. New demos and tools are being brought out almost daily that introduce something new you can play around with or explore. Awesome WebGL demos push what most people thought was possible in the browser to a new limit. When Dominic, the creator of ImpactJS, released Ejecta last week I was genuinely excited about what I and others can do with this and the doors it opens up. Imagine thinking you’re learning one thing, and then someone coming out with an awesome tool or framework to do something totally different with the things you’ve learned. With Ejecta, that is easy deployment on iOS devices. And the cool thing is, these kinds of things happen on a regular basis with JavaScript and HTML5. People are building new things quickly and sharing them with other JS developers.
